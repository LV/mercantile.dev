Welcome to my devlog page! I've taken on this project because I've wanted to build many cool things related to finance and the markets. I want to dive deep into cool algorithms and model collective behavior. However, as an individual I do not have the infrastructure to compete in the stock market, so I've decided to make a video game instead where I can build all these things little-by-little.

This project is my attempt at writing performant, interesting, and fun software that hopefully you'll also find interesting. This webpage will document my journey along this project and I'd love for you to be a part of this.
